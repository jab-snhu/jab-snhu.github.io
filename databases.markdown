# Databases

## Event Tracker Android App – Cloud Database Migration

### Introduction

For the Databases category, I continued enhancing the Event Tracker Android app that I began working on for the Software Engineering and Design category. The artifact was originally created as the final project for the CS 360 Mobile Architecture and Programming course in October 2025. The app allows users to create and manage a list of upcoming events and receive reminder notifications before the event begins. For the Software Engineering and Design enhancement, I replaced the unencrypted local authentication system with a secure cloud-based solution using Firebase Authentication. For this enhancement, I replaced the local Room database with Firebase Firestore, migrating from a SQLite relational database to a NoSQL document-oriented database.

### Justification

The Event Tracker app was selected for the Databases category because it provided an opportunity to explore different database types and designs as well as migrate an existing application from a local database solution to a cloud-based one. The enhancement showcases my ability to work with cloud databases and structure data for NoSQL documents.

Migrating from Room to Firestore required significant architectural updates in the code. The local SQL database used automatically generated `long` IDs for events, while Firestore's autogenerated document IDs are of type `String`. This foundational change required updates throughout the codebase, including updating the `Event` entity, repository interfaces, view models and activities. All code specific to Room was systematically removed and replaced with a Firestore implementation. The `EventRepository` for example, was completely rewritten to use Firestore operations instead of Room DAO calls. When performing its operations Room uses backgrounding threading through executor and handler patterns. In contrast, Firestore handles its asynchronous operations through completion listeners and callbacks. This required updates to all CRUD operations to be consistent with the use of the Firestore callbacks, matching the approach used when integrating with Firebase Authentication.

One great improvement of this enhancement is the real-time synchronization of data. Firestore automatically pushes updates whenever data changes in the cloud. This makes the app feel much more connected and like a legitimate product. Making a change while logged in on one of your devices will now immediately update the data on all your devices. This is a major upgrade from Room's `LiveData` implementation, which was limited to only displaying local changes.

### Course Outcomes

The enhancements for the Event Tracker artifact address course outcomes 3, 4, and 5 in the following ways:

**Outcome 3 – Computer Science Standards and Practices:**
The migration from Room to Firestore required careful consideration of the trade-offs between a relational SQL database and a document-based NoSQL database. The new code architecture kept best practices in mind by decoupling the database logic from the UI, making future updates or migrations easier to manage.

**Outcome 4 – Innovative Techniques:**
The use of Firebase Firestore shows my ability to work with modern, industry-standard cloud database tools widely used in mobile app development. The implementation demonstrates real-time data synchronization, cloud-based database storage, and asynchronous programming patterns, all of which are heavily used in mobile apps.

**Outcome 5 – Security:**
Specific security rules were added to the Firestore configuration to ensure only authenticated users have access to their data. Combined with the Firebase Authentication enhancement from the Software Engineering and Design category, the app now has a complete and secure backend solution with encrypted communication and user access controls, both of which were lacking in the original implementation.

### Reflection

Understanding the architectural and design differences between SQL and NoSQL databases provided the most significant learning for this enhancement. With the Room implementation, I used foreign key relationships, tables, and standard SQL queries to perform database operations. Firestore, which uses documents and collections, required rethinking how data is structured. It feels almost like a folder structure where a given event can be found in a document via the path `users/{userId}/events/{eventId}`.

This migration also reinforced the value of proper separation of code and the Repository pattern the app uses. Because I already had a clean separation between the data layer and the view models, swapping out Room for Firestore was relatively contained to a significant rewrite of the `EventRepository` class. The API for the repository did not change significantly, so the view models and activities were largely untouched through the migration, validating many of the app's architectural decisions.

One challenge I faced was updating the ID type from `long` to `String`. This sounds simple on the surface, but this change had a cascading effect and required careful updates throughout the codebase. This also meant I had to do a minor refactor of the `EventReminderManager` to work with `String` IDs. Another challenge was learning how to correctly query Firestore to return only future events in chronological order. This required using a combination of filter configurations to recreate the original Room query.

Overall, this enhancement showcases my ability to migrate an existing application with a local storage solution to a real-time, cloud-based system while adhering to clean code principles and enabling increased security. Combined with the Firebase Authentication enhancement from the Software Engineering and Design category, the Firestore database functionality gives the Event Tracker app a production-ready backend that can operate at scale.
