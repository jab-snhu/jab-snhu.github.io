## Professional Self-Assessment

I began working in software development over 15 years ago as a freelance programmer. My freelance work turned into a job at a startup, which ultimately led to employment for larger scale companies including The Walt Disney Company, where I currently manage a team of mobile developers. After years of self-learning, I decided to formalize my education by completing the Computer Science program at Southern New Hampshire University, where I sought to expand my practical knowledge with a deeper understanding of the theoretical principles of programming. The coursework challenged me to consider algorithm design, software architecture, and security in new ways, directly impacting the quality of the products I help build on a daily basis.

As a software engineer transitioning into engineering management, this program has provided a comprehensive view of the full technology stack. During my tenure at SNHU, I've studied everything from data structures and algorithms to database design with a focus on maintaining secure coding practices and following proper software testing methodologies. The breadth of topics in the program has made me a more versatile engineer and a more effective collaborator. Looking ahead, I plan to continue my education by pursuing a graduate degree, building on the strong foundation provided by SNHU. My ePortfolio showcases the skills and knowledge I have developed, demonstrated through enhancements to artifacts that highlight my abilities in collaboration, communication, data structures and algorithms, software engineering and databases, and security.

## Collaborating in a Team Environment

To be an effective collaborator in software development means having an understanding of the work involved across disciplines and the ability to communicate well with colleagues with different areas of expertise. SNHU prepared me for this by providing exposure to the full technology stack, building everything from user-facing applications to backend databases, all while focusing on software architecture and algorithm design. Throughout the program, I worked with several languages including C++, Java, Python, TypeScript, and Swift, building projects that ranged from creating a scene in computer graphics in CS 330 to building a full-stack travel website in CS 465 to creating an event tracking Android mobile app in CS 360. The scope of the curriculum helped me understand the work that team members perform across different domains. In my professional role leading a team of mobile developers, I apply these principles on a daily basis as I facilitate discussions between engineers across the stack, product managers, and stakeholders. Additionally, the modular, well-documented code practices emphasized by the program help make code accessible and maintainable for all team members, directly supporting collaborative development.

## Communicating with Stakeholders

Whether I'm explaining technical decisions to non-technical stakeholders or writing code documentation for fellow engineers, clear communication is essential in software development. Throughout the program at SNHU, I developed skills in both written and oral technical communication. The code review video for the capstone project required presenting existing code, analyzing areas for improvement, and explaining planned enhancements in a clear, concise way that provided a comprehensive overview of the work without getting lost in the implementation details. The narratives accompanying each artifact showcase my written communication by articulating design decisions, reflecting on any challenges I encountered, and connecting the enhancements to the main course outcomes. Within the code written for all classes, I maintained professional documentation standards by using inline comments where appropriate and making use of language-specific commenting conventions like JavaDoc for Java and DocC for Swift. This helps make sure that code is readable and maintainable by future developers.

## Data Structures and Algorithms

Writing efficient and scalable code requires a strong foundation in data structures and algorithms. CS 300 provided this foundation with projects involving binary search trees, hash tables, and linked lists alongside Big O analysis of their complexity. Understanding these trade-offs empowers me to make informed decisions with confidence when determining the proper approach for a given problem. For the capstone project, I ported a course catalog program developed in CS 300 from C++ to Swift, writing a [generic binary search tree](https://github.com/jab-snhu/jab-snhu.github.io/tree/main/Course%20Catalog) from scratch since Swift does not include one in its standard library. The implementation has O(log n) average time complexity when performing insert or search operations using recursive traversal algorithms. I used Swift generics to make the structure reusable in future projects, requiring only that tree elements conform to the `Comparable` protocol. This combination of algorithmic efficiency and language-specific best practices showcases my ability to develop in different languages and environments while considering the trade-offs involved in the implementation decisions.

## Software Engineering and Databases

Understanding how different components interact across the stack to handle data is a key element of building maintainable software. Throughout the program, I gained experience with both relational and non-relational databases, building a full-stack travel website with MongoDB in CS 465 and working with SQLite and Android's Room library in CS 360. For the capstone project, I migrated the [Event Tracker](https://github.com/jab-snhu/jab-snhu.github.io/tree/main/Event%20Tracker) app from a local Room database to Firebase Firestore, updating the architecture from Room's relational SQL model to Firestore's document-oriented NoSQL design. This required rethinking how data was organized and accessed throughout the app while maintaining the existing MVVM app architecture. The migration also added real-time data synchronization so any updates to the data reflect immediately across all of a user's devices. In terms of software design, the integration with Firebase Authentication is abstracted using an interface, decoupling the dependency and making it easier to change or add authentication providers in the future. This design keeps the code flexible and more maintainable, allowing changes to be made with minimal impact to the rest of the app.

## Security

Developing software with a security mindset means programming with security as a primary concern and anticipating vulnerabilities before they can be exploited. CS 305 provided thorough exposure to this approach through projects focused on identifying and mitigating security risks. I performed manual code reviews to identify issues like unsanitized inputs, hardcoded credentials, and exposed API parameters. I also used the OWASP Dependency-Check tool to audit third-party libraries for known vulnerabilities and provide remediation recommendations. The projects also covered encryption, where I implemented AES-256 for data protection and configured HTTPS using self-signed certificates for secure client-server communication. For the capstone project, I enhanced the [Event Tracker](https://github.com/jab-snhu/jab-snhu.github.io/tree/main/Event%20Tracker) Android mobile app to remove unencrypted passwords stored in a local database. I replaced the local authentication system with secure Firebase Authentication, which handles all authentication communication through encrypted services. I also configured the server-side security rules to ensure users only have access to their own data. These enhancements showcase my ability to identify security flaws in existing code and program with a security-first mindset.

## Capstone Project, Artifacts, and Course Outcomes

The artifacts in my ePortfolio include the [Event Tracker](https://github.com/jab-snhu/jab-snhu.github.io/tree/main/Event%20Tracker) Android app originally developed in CS 360 and the [Course Catalog](https://github.com/jab-snhu/jab-snhu.github.io/tree/main/Course%20Catalog) CLI application originally developed in CS 300. These two projects were enhanced across the three capstone categories showcasing my skills in software design and engineering, data structures and algorithms, and databases.

For software design and engineering, I replaced the [Event Tracker](https://github.com/jab-snhu/jab-snhu.github.io/tree/main/Event%20Tracker) app's insecure local authentication with cloud-based Firebase Authentication, utilizing an interface-based abstraction to keep the implementation decoupled from the rest of the codebase. The [Course Catalog](https://github.com/jab-snhu/jab-snhu.github.io/tree/main/Course%20Catalog) CLI application was rewritten from the ground up with a modular architecture focused on a clear separation of concerns and professional documentation using DocC comments. For algorithms and data structures, I further enhanced the [Course Catalog](https://github.com/jab-snhu/jab-snhu.github.io/tree/main/Course%20Catalog) CLI application to use a generic binary search tree with O(log n) insert and search operations, demonstrating my ability to translate complex algorithmic concepts to a new language. Lastly, for databases, I migrated the [Event Tracker](https://github.com/jab-snhu/jab-snhu.github.io/tree/main/Event%20Tracker) app's database implementation from Room to Firestore, transitioning from SQL to NoSQL while maintaining the app's MVVM architecture and adding real-time data synchronization from the cloud.

As discussed above, these enhancements collectively address all five course outcomes by building collaborative environments with modular, well-documented code, delivering professional written and oral communication through capstone narratives and the video code review, applying algorithmic principles with attention to efficiency and trade-offs, using modern tools and techniques such as Firebase to deliver professional-level solutions, and demonstrating a security mindset by identifying and eliminating security vulnerabilities in the original Event Tracker implementation.
